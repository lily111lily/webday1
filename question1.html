<h1>Von Dutch</h1>
It's okay to just admit that you're jealous of me<br>
Yeah, I heard you talk about me, that's the word on the street<br>
You're obsessin', just confess it, put your hands up<br>
It's obvious, I'm your number one<br>
<br>
It's alright to just admit that I'm the fantasy<br>
You're obsessin', just confess it 'cause it's obvious<br>
I'm your number one, I'm your number one<br>
I'm your number one, yeah, I'm just livin' that life<br>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Von Dutch, cult classic but I still pop</li>
    <li>I get money, you get mad because the bank shut</li>
    <li>Yeah, I know your little secret, put your hands up</li>
    <li> It's so obvious, I'm your number one, life</li>
